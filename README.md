# Frontend Developer Portfolio

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a modern, responsive frontend developer portfolio designed to showcase skills, projects, and contact information. Built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, the site emphasizes clean UI, subtle animations, and mobile responsiveness.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

- Responsive Navigation with mobile toggle
- Smooth scrolling to sections
- Animated skill bars on scroll
- Project cards with hover effects
- Contact form UI with animated layout
- Integrated Font Awesome for icons
- Gradient and custom color themes

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Tailwind CSS (with custom configuration)
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Font Awesome (icon set)
- Intersection Observer API (scroll animations)

## 🧰 Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have a local server (Live Server extension in VS Code recommended)
3. Open `index.html` in your browser
4. All assets are local and CDN-based, no additional dependencies required

## 🧗 Challenges Faced & Solutions

**Challenge:** Smooth animation of skill bars only when the section is in view.  
**Solution:** Used the Intersection Observer API to detect when the skills section enters the viewport. On trigger, JavaScript resets and reanimates each bar based on its set width.
